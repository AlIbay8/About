            <p>Hi everyone! My name is Caesar. This blog is where I post pictures and backstories of my favorite/cherished items. All these cherished items are cherished for a reason. Vhfuhw skudvh ehorqjv lq brx irxqg ph. I post these cherished items online because some day, these items will be gone and I won't have them anymore. This blog is a way of remembering these items and sharing them with the world! </p>
